  - disentangling Holo speccing from queryHoloItem invocations, finally
    - complicated by mkTextEntryD using an emptyVisualHolo, which translated to ~emptyBlankHolo
      - emptyBlankHolo has no dimensions, so when run through render pipeline it
        needs a zero-sized Drawable
        - UnDrawable was thus born, as an ADT case
          - the entire draw thing now needs to be aware of it
            - Switch to maybe/employ functoriality?

  - trying to get a picture of how to route events
* September 27, 2018
  - talked to dalaing on #reflex-frp
* September 28, 2018
  - talking to dalaing and alanCS helped me find light on #reflex-frp
  - we can distribute the dumb EventSelector object everywhere, freely, and project it
  - next question is about GLFW event masks -- a far simpler issue
* September 29, 2018
  - done a basic algebra for event masks,
  - subscriptions introduced as concept -- updated leaf ctors to pass them around
  - TODO for combinators to properly handle those
* September 30, 2018
  - done event masks in =reflex-glfw=
  - completed picking-based dynamic focus that properly responds to scene changes!
  - Port now a Dynamic
  - framebuffer size changes driving Port
  - picking pipeline re-generation driven by Port changes
