  - disentangling Holo speccing from queryHoloItem invocations, finally
    - complicated by mkTextEntryD using an emptyVisualHolo, which translated to ~emptyBlankHolo
      - emptyBlankHolo has no dimensions, so when run through render pipeline it
        needs a zero-sized Drawable
        - UnDrawable was thus born, as an ADT case
          - the entire draw thing now needs to be aware of it
            - Switch to maybe/employ functoriality?
* September 26, 2018
  - trying to get a picture of how to route events
* September 27, 2018
  - talked to dalaing on #reflex-frp
* September 28, 2018
  - talking to dalaing and alanCS helped me find light on #reflex-frp
  - we can distribute the dumb EventSelector object everywhere, freely, and project it
  - next question is about GLFW event masks -- a far simpler issue
* September 29, 2018
  - done a basic algebra for event masks,
  - subscriptions introduced as concept -- updated leaf ctors to pass them around
  - TODO for combinators to properly handle those
* September 30, 2018
  - done event masks in =reflex-glfw=
  - completed picking-based dynamic focus that properly responds to scene changes!
  - Port now a Dynamic
  - framebuffer size changes driving Port
  - picking pipeline re-generation driven by Port changes
  - started rewriting MRecord to accomodate generic FRP widged derivation
    - faced complexity of the holo/dynamic API
    - started simplifying it, and mostly succeeded for simple cases
      - complex cases are, well, involved: mkTextEntryD & mkTextEntryValidateD
        - complicated because of Style interactivity knot tying
          - simple cases have their default style baked in
        - we still have the old problem of style Behavior taking effect on next redraw
      - maybe there is still some generality to lift there
* October 1, 2018
  - we don't want to create a dynamic from a dynamic -- rather one from a value,
    since our task is to lift a non-interactive value.
  - ..and the above wish was granted, liftDyn is now a Holo class method
* October 3, 2018
  - so, 'readField' needs to be monadic, at least because of MonadHold, and therefore
    'hsequence' and =<< in 'recover'
* October 6, 2018
  - cue much suffering and fun from hitting dead ends & trying to upgrade to GHC
    8.6.1, that turned into an attempt to build GHC to improve its logging, to
    track down a compiler panic..
* October 11, 2018
  - we need readField to transform the type -- from structural to derived
    - the argument-side type-level lists are over the structural type
    - the return-side type needs to reflect the change of type from structural to derived
      - (NP m xs) is current, but doesn't reflect that change
        - it's still useful to be able to refer to the structural type
        - if we want to keep the unmodified NP to work for us, we need to change
          its first argument to include the aforementioned change of type
* October 13, 2018
  - the Prod m Derived needs expression to unify with regards to t, that is baked into m
    - ergo we have m ~ ReflexGLFW t mb at the top level, to make t available for unification
      - ..which makes GHC complain: Could not deduce: Ref mb ~ GHC.IORef.IORef
        - ..and we have to placate it with: ReflexGLFWCtx t mb
          - and that works
          - but it's unwieldy, and so ReflexGLFWCtx t m mb
* October 17, 2018
  - so, the question seems to be -- how do we manage to switch from the record's
    ConsCtx to the field's Record so smoothly.. ?
* TODO
  - [ ] simplify the holo/dynamic construction model
  - [ ] generics-sop to construct an interactive FRP widget for a value
