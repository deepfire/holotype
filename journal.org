  - disentangling Holo speccing from queryHoloItem invocations, finally
    - complicated by mkTextEntryD using an emptyVisualHolo, which translated to ~emptyBlankHolo
      - emptyBlankHolo has no dimensions, so when run through render pipeline it
        needs a zero-sized Drawable
        - UnDrawable was thus born, as an ADT case
          - the entire draw thing now needs to be aware of it
            - Switch to maybe/employ functoriality?
